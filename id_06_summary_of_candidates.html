<p>The table provides a summary of 52 known antigens (including 4 reference antigens) and the top 200 antigen candidates. It includes columns for protein IDs, probability scores, antigen/candidate groups, gene products, closest known antigens, distance to the closest antigens, gene essentiality, and single-cell gene expression at various life stages.</p>
<p>You can easily visualize the corresponding values with colored bars for probability scores and gene expressions. Grey bars indicate probability scores. Red, blue, and light green bars represent the proportion of cells expressing the gene, median expression level, and mean expression level of the cell population, respectively.</p>
<p>To view columns on the right, scroll right for more information. To filter columns according to specific criteria, click on the white boxes under the headers to set thresholds. You can also sort values in ascending or descending order by clicking on the arrows next to the header.</p>
